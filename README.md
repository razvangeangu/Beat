### An iOS and Android app, developed by Aman Khosa, Danail Penev and RÄƒzvan Gabriel Geangu for the 2016 Facebook London Hackathon.

The application makes use of a server developed on Python flask and hosted on Heroku. The Heroku server will be available until 2:30pm GMT on 13/3/2016.


Initial version enables 2 or more users to listen to the same song at the same time via Internet connection. 
The song is selected from a playlist, integrated in the app. The server support unlimited number of different rooms(with different songs playing in them) with unlimited number of people in them at the same time.

## How-to:

### Installation
Install the Android .apk from [HERE](http://bit.ly/1QVn0YU)

Come to us(next to the queen) to get the iOS version installed (or install it by yourself, you smart person, you have our code in the repository anyway)

### Getting-started
One of the people that are to be connected selects to be the host. They create the room by setting a name for it.

The other person(or people) then joins the room by entering its name.

The host then selects the song and it gets played on both(or all) devices.

### Explore
Try out the different features of the app by pausing, changing the song or skipping through it.

Listen to the same music as your friend(s) no matter where they are.
