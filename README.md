### An iOS and Android app, developed by Aman Khosa, Danail Penev and RÄƒzvan Gabriel Geangu for the 2016 Facebook London Hackathon.

The application makes use of a server developed on Python flask and hosted on Heroku. The Heroku server will be available until 2:30pm GMT on 13/3/2016.


Initial version enables 2 or more users to listen to the same song at the same time via Internet connection. 
The song is selected from a playlist, integrated in the app. The server support unlimited number of different rooms(with different songs playing in them) with unlimited number of people in them at the same time.

## How-to:

### Installation
Install the Android .apk from HERE

Come to us(next to the queen) to get the iOS version installed

### Getting-started
One of the people that are to be connected selects the part of the host. They create the room by setting it a name.

The other person(or people) then joins the room by entering its name.

The host then selects the song and it gets played on both(or all) devices.

### Explore
Try out with pausing, changing the song or skipping through it.

Listen the same music as your friend(s) no matter where they are.
